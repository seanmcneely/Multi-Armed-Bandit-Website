# Multi-Armed-Bandit-Website

Optimizing my personal website with multi-armed-bandit algorithms, an alternative to A/B testing! 

This framework is designed to accomodate testing any number of website versions against each other to determine which solicits the most user interaction or other reward. 

## Usage:
To use this MAB framework, you first must decide what actions on your webpage you want users to take. For example, you may want users to read your mission statement or buy a product. Once you have determined actions you want to reward, assign these action relative scores/importance. For example, maybe reading the mission is worth 5 points, and buying a product is worth 10. This allows you to make some actions worth more than others.
